Spec List
If you need to reproduce an environment across computers with the same operating system, you can generate a spec list. 
For example, if you’re teaching a course and need to copy the environment for course exercises, the – -explicit option will produce a list of packages. 
To write the environment specifications to a file:

conda list --explicit spec-list.txt

To recreate the environment:

conda create --name python-course --file spec-list.txt
